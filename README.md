# NCKU Program Design I – C Coursework

This repository contains lecture materials, code examples, and practice problems for the course **Program Design I (PD1)** offered by the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering at **National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)**.

## 🧠 Course Topics

The course introduces foundational C programming concepts, including:

- **C Programming Fundamentals**
  - Data types, operators, and expressions
  - Control structures (conditionals & loops)
  - Function declaration and scope

- **Advanced Programming Concepts**
  - Recursion and recursive thinking
  - Pointers and memory addressing
  - Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
  - String manipulation and array handling
  - Structures, unions, and enumerations
  - Linked lists and basic data structure manipulation
